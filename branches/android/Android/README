This directory contains the Android port of NDT.

Build requirements:
  - The Android SDK (available from http://developer.android.com/sdk/)
    * Note: SDK .tar.gz merely needs to be unfurled
  - Apache Ant (available from http://ant.apache.org/)
  - JDK 5 or 6 (available from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/)

Build instructions:

1. Create a 'local.properties' file to specify the SDK path:

  sdk-location=/usr/local/foo/android/android-sdk-linux_86

2. Use ant to build in this directory:

  $ ant debug

3. Install bin/AndroidNdt-debug.apk on an emulator or device.

  For emulators or USB-connected devices:
  $ ant install

  Note: for this to work, 'USB Debugging' will need to be enabled on the device
  (Settings -> Applications -> Development). You can also download the apk on
  the device and install it directly, provided "Unknown sources" (in Settings ->
  Applications) is enabled.

For release builds, use 'ant release', and sign bin/AndroidNdt-unsigned.apk with
a release key before publishing it to the Market.

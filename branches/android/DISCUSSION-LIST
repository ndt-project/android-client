Your mailing list has been established.  It is being served by an
automated mailing list manager that responds to commands emailed to
the "Majordomo address" listed above.  This message has all the details
of how to manage your list remotely using Majordomo.  If you have any
questions, refer them to the Majordomo-Owner address listed above.

There's a lot of info here, so please read this completely and
carefully, and save it for future reference.  If you have any questions,
you should send them to the Majordomo-Owner address above.

Your list-owner password is shown above.  Keep track of this; you'll
need it later.  Instructions for changing your password are below.

As soon as possible, please issue a "newinfo" command for your
list (see below) to create the file that someone will receive when
they join or ask about your list.

You can issue a "who" command for your list to see who's already on your
list.  You may or may not already be subscribed to your own list.

The Gory Details
================

Your mailing list is managed by an automated mailing list management
program called Majordomo.  Majordomo should free you from dealing
with most of the administrivia usually associated with running mailing
lists (adding users, dropping users, etc.).

To submit something to your list, you (or anybody else) should simply
mail it to the list posting address shown at the top of this file.

If somebody sends something to list request address shown above (which
is the traditional Internet way of being added to a mailing list), they'll
get back a message telling them how to use Majordomo for routine requests,
and how to contact you if they need to speak to a human being.

To be added to your list, a user simply sends a message with an empty 
"Subject:" line and with the following line in the body of the message:

    subscribe ndt

by email to majordomo@anl.gov.

The mail message to subscribe to the ndt mailing list would be:

   To: majordomo@anl.gov
   subscribe ndt

or:

   To: majordomo@anl.gov
   Subject:
   subscribe ndt

where each of the above lines starts in column 1 and there is no "Subject:"
line or the "Subject:" line is empty.

Majordomo understands several commands, and is not limited to a
single command per message (it will process commands until reaching
end-of-message or the command "end").  The command "help" will tell
you about all the other commands.

Actually, it won't tell you about _all_ the other commands that 
Majordomo understands.  There are several commands there for use by
list owners such as yourself, which are not advertised to the public.
All of these commands are password-protected on a list-by-list basis,
but anyone with a valid list/password combination can invoke these
commands.  This is not exactly high-tech security, but it's more
intended to keep annoyance to a minimum than to be foolproof. 

The "documented" commands which Majordomo understands and which are
for everyone to use are:

    subscribe ndt [<address>]
    unsubscribe ndt [<address>]
    which [<address>]
    who ndt
    info ndt
    index ndt
    get ndt <filename>
    lists
    help
    end

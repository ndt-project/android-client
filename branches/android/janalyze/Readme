JAnalyze - The log analyzer for the NDT system.


The JAnalyze program reads the log generated by the web100srv
application and displays the information about performed tests. All
the results are loaded into the memory and stored for the future
use. The JAnalyze recognizes the attached snaplog and cputime trace
files, which can be displayed in an appropriate way.


USAGE:

After running the application (`java JAnalyze` in the janalyze
directory) the proper web100srv.log can be chosen by the 'Load'
option in the 'File' menu.

When the web100srv.log file is loaded, the short descriptions of the
performed tests are displayed in the list on the left side of the
window. The full description is displayed on the right panel after
selecting the item from the list.

The full description of the performed test contains all the
information that also 'analyze' can display. Moreover, there is some
info about availability of the snaplog and cputime trace files.

The information contained in the cputime trace file can be displayed
by clicking the 'view' button. The duration of the test is printed on
the X-axis, the cpu time spent executing instructions
(user/system/cuser/csystem) is displayed on the Y-axis.

The results can be filtered out by several criteria:
 - IP of the client (only the selected ones are displayed)
 - mismatch condition
 - cable fault condition
 - congestion condition
 - duplex condition
 - new congestion condition
 - initial peak speed condition

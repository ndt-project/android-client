TFW - The testing framework for the NDT system.


The TFW tool is a client/server program that provides the possibility
to test the various detecting algorithms used by the Network
Diagnostic Tester (NDT). The system is composed of a single server and
multiple client programs.


USAGE:

The single instance of the server should be started on the well known
machine. Then, the appropriate number of clients should be started on
the various computers. The command-line arguments to the client.py:
  - host - the hostname of the server
  - port - the port on which the server is running
  - publicaddr - the public address of the machine on which client is
    running.

On the server side the testing scenario should be created. It contains
the set of hosts, which take part in the test. Each of the hosts must
be assigned to one of the connected clients.

The hosts can have multiple 'traffics'. In each 'traffic' the target
client and the throughput, on which the data will be send, must be
specified. 

The start button in the scenario enables all the specified traffic.
The stop button stops the scenario completely.


FUTURE EXTENSIONS:

 - automatic NDT client/server starting
 - automatic logs retrieval
 - possibility to specify the set of scenarios with different settings

This file contains a list of changes to the ANL/Internet2 Network
Diagnostic Tool (NDT) tester.  There are 4 programs that are used
for this tester.  

1) the Tcpbw100.java program, downloads to the users desktop. 
The web100 variables are shipped to this process for analysis
on the desktop. 

2) the fakewww.c program.  This process runs on the server and
listens for new connections from user desktop's. It writes some
messages to the access log (default location:
/usr/local/ndt/access_log) and error log (default location:
/usr/local/ndt/error_log).

3) the web100srv.c program.  This process communicates with the
Java applet, runs the throughput tests, and gathers the web100
data.  It also writes some of the data out to a log file on the
server for later analysis.

4) the web100clt.c program.  This process is a command line version
of the client code.  It augments the Tcpbw100.java program, allowing
the user to pre-install a version of the client code.  This allows
non-browser based clients, helpful for remote access testing.

	  3/14/05

1/28/05 - NDT v3.1.1
  tr-mkmap.c
	Bug fix.  gcc version 3.4.2 (and possibly others) don't
	like my use of the goto label; statement.  It was an easy
	way to jump around some code for error handling.  The
	fix is to use more conventional break, continue, and if()
	statements.

1/24/05 - NDT v3.1.0
  web100srv.c
	Modified code to use new duplex mismatch algorighm.  The
	current heuristic can be used by selecting the '-o' option.
	The new algorithm use the ratio of ack pkts to data packets
	plus the ratio of send vs receive speed.  This algorithm
	came from the analytical analysis done in late 04 and early
	05.  

  web100clt.c
	Modified code to use new asymmeteric speed to print out
	mismatch direction (NIC = full or half).  The existing
	code simply accepts the mismatch variable from the server
	so no other change was needed.

  Tcpbw100.java v5.3.3c
	Same as above, lets the applet print the right direction
	message.

1/24/05 - Tcpbw100.java v5.3.3b
	David Richter <richterd@citi.umich.edu> reformated the 
	raw java file, making it MUCH easier to understand what
	is going on.

1/19/05 - NDT v3.1.0
  analyze.c
	Bug fix to handle letter 'p' in host name.  The word
	'port' signifizes the start of a new test.  The code
	uses the strchr() function to find the letter 'p' in
	the input string.  Code would fail if hostname contained
	the letter 'p'.

	Added code to calculate and report mismatch state based
	on new mismatch algorithm using ack to data packet ratio
	and upload to download speed ratio.  

12/14/04 - NDT v3.0.24
  web100srv.c
	Modified data receive loop to use timer to prevent
	routine from hanging in read loop forever.  Used
	select() with 12 second wait time.  Test should run
	for 10 seconds so loop should exit normally.  If not
	then loop is killed after 12 seconds.  Note: Linux updates
	the time value everytime select() exits - due to r/w
	signal on socket.  This means you don't need to re-insert
	a new time.  BSD does not work this way and needs a different
	mechanism (see web100clt code).

12/8/04 - NDT v3.0.24
  web100clt.c
	Modified data receive loop to use timer to prevent
	routine from hanging in read state forever.  Used Select()
	to run 12 second timers.

11/28/04 - NDT v3.0.24
  web100srv.c
	Added in some autotuning code.  The web100 kernel patch 
	provides some autotuning of the TCP connection.  This function
	is enabled/disabled on a per connection basis based on the 
	setting of the web100_{r|s}bufmode variable.  If true (1) then
	a window scale factor of 7 (web100_default_wscale) is used and the
	TCP send/recv buffer is set to 64 KB << 7.  If false (0) then no
	autotuning is performed.  Unfortunatly, this function has been
	depreciated by the web100 design team, and the server program
	may not autotune the connection to use large buffers.  This version
	now looks at the web100_{r|s}bufmode settings and if false, does
	it's own version of autotuning.  First it sets the TCP send/receive
	buffer to a large value using the setsockopt() call.  Then it limits
	the max value to something less than this using the LimCwnd and LimRwin
	web100 variables.  This probably needs some more work.
  web100-util.c
	Implemented the autotuning functions noted above.  Three new functions
	are created (1) web100_setbuff() sets the LimCwnd and LimRwin variables
	to (64*1024)<< scale factor (64 KBytes shifted by scale factor.  (2) 
	web100_autotune() checks to see if web100_{r|s}bufmode is true or false.
	(3) web100_rtt() returns the average rtt for the control connection.  This
	should give us a baseline on the RTT and may be useful in autotuning.

  Applet/Makefile.am and Admin/Makefile.am
	Finally fixed an annoying bug in the build process.  The javac compiler was
	always called, even if there was nothing to do.  A new routine in the Makefile
	now tests to see if the timestamp file exists, and skips the compile if true.
	(there is probably a better way, but this works for now.)

11/13/04 - NDT v3.0.23
  web100srv.c
	bug fix.  Changed ',' (comma) character to ':' (colon) in
	error message.  The ',' is the seperator for the send string
	of web100 vars, and it may confuse the admin view generation
	routine.
	bug fix. The date of the latest test was not being updated.
	the 'date[32]' variable was moved to a local var and it was
	not being passed to the calculate() and gen_html() routines.
	It is now passed into the calculate() routine, and it is a global
	in the web100-admin.c file.

  web100-admin.c
	bug fix.  Pick-up change from web100srv.c above.  The current date
	is now passed into the calcualte() routine and then copied to the
	global date[32] variable.  This var is used in the admin.html file
	to show the date of the latest test.

10/25/04 - ndt v3.0.22
  web100srv.c
	bug fix.  The kill() signal below works, but the testing and
	waiting flags were not being changed.  This caused the server
	to believe that non-existant clients were waiting in the FIFO
	queue.

10/4/04 - ndt v3.0.21
  web100srv.c
	Bug fix.  The kill() function was sending the wrong signal
	when a stuck process was detected.  The stuck process detection
	was sending a sig=0 signal (log the action, but don't actually
	do it).  This was changed to send the SIGKILL (9) signal.  It
	appears that the parent process occasionally misses an interrupt
	signal, probably due to it being masked by a second signal, and
	a child process gets stuck.  This condition is detected and it
	should be handled properly now.

8/18/04 - ndt v3.0.20
  web100srv.c
	Added code to process "disable_FIFO", "syslog", and "Debug"
	options via the ndt.conf file.  The debug option requires
	a value, the debug message level, while the other 2 are boolean
	flags.  
  ndt.conf.man
	added in text to describe how these options are specified.
  conf/ndt
	A simple startup script that will allow the NDT server processes
	to start at boot time.  Thanks to Pete Bertoncini <pjb@anl.gov> 
	for this script.
  conf/autostart.sh
	This simple scritp automates the installation of the conf/ndt
	script.  The conf/ndt script is moved into the /etc/init.d
	system directory and the /sbin.chkconfig --add ndt command is
	run to automatically create the rc?.d slinks.  The conf/autostart.sh
	script should be run once, when the NDT package is first installed
	on a system.

8/16/04	- ndt v3.0.19
  web100clt.c
	bugfix.  The mylink variable was not being set, so buffer
	size recommendation messages were not being given.  

	Added code to print an information message if the receive
	buffer could more than double throughput.  New message will
	calcualte the buffer size required to maximize throughput.
	Note value can be verified by using the -b# option.

  Tcpbw100.java v5.3.3a
	Same changes were made to the applet version.  

8/9/04 - ndt v3.0.19
  web100srv.c
	bugfix.  change byte descriptor from int to double to prevent
	overrunning at greater than gigabit rates (caused negative
	throughput rates to be reported).

	Added in new "-s" for syslog, option.  This option causes
	the server to write usage statistics using the syslog
	facility at local0 levels.  This will allow the data to be
	sent to a remote host for archival purposes.

7/28/04 - ndt v3.0.18
  tcpbw100.template
	This file is modified by the create-html.sh script creating
	the main NDT web page (tcpbw100.html).  The applet code now
	resides in a table, allowing the applet to appear in the
	center of the window, and not randomly aligned.  The list of
	public servers was also modified to include the new NSF server.

7/15/04 - ndt v3.0.17
  fakewww.c
	The server now writes redirect messages to the log file.

7/14/04 - ndt v3.0.16
  web100clt.c
	added in code to recognize old servers, those that don't
	support queuing, and exit gracefully.  Old servers relied
	on the client to analyze the connection data, new servers
	perform the analysis and pass the results back to the 
	client.

7/9/04 - ndt v3.0.15
  web100clt.c
	Added fflush() commands to code following "running xxx to yyy"
	test message.  This allows the message to appear on the screen
	now, instead of when the test results are obtained

  tr-tree.c
	Changes and bug fixes to the Federation mode's traceroute
	comparison routines.  Bug fix corrects the problem where
	the map file (Default.tree) contained an incomplete path.
	prepended BASEDIR variable to file name.
	New comparison logic to detemine when route to client 
	diverges from route to a remote NDT server.  Handles
	cases where remote client is NDT server, and when
	paths diverge early.  (Note: local NDT servers's IP
	address MUST be root node in the map.  This is achieved
	by making the 1st traceroute to `uanme -n`.

7/6/04 - analyze.c
  Bug fixes.  The analyze program allows you to review the data
    found in the web100srv.log file.  These changes include making
    the program more robust in the face of errors in the log file.
    One fix was to handle the months "Apr" and "Sep", these strings
    were confusing the detection of the "port" string, which indicates
    the start of a new test.  A second fix changed the number of
    variables found in the link detection algorithm.  The program now
    accounts for 2 different counts.  Finally, a new duplex detection
    algorithm was implemented and it compares this algorithm to the
    original algorithm.

7/6/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.14
  New duplex mismatch detection algorithm implemented.  This change
    removed the test for a specific link type and addes in a test for
    the amount of idle time due to Timeouts replaces this condition.
    This change eliminates the false positives in my local tests.  

7/6/04 - web100clt.c
  Bug fix.  Added in missing tests to capture 4 variables (mismatch
    half_duplex, congestion, and bad_cable) passed over from the server.
    These use to be calculated here, but now come from the server.

  Added new condition to determine if switch or host is in HD mode.  Now
    use the out-of-order value instead of throughput rate.

7/6/04 - tcpbw100.java b5.3.2b
  Same changes as applies to web100clt.c (listed above).

6/14/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.13
  bug fix to window scale detection logic.  Incorrectly applied
    winscale factor to servers send buffer.  Correct action is to
    only set buffer value (Sndbuf) when both send and receive scale
    factors are greater than 0.

6/14/04 - web100clt.c
  bug fix.  Value for timesec wasn't being picked up, caused
    % of idle time to be infinite (divide by zero error)

6/14/04 - web100-util.c
  bug fix.  record SndWinScale value so above fix works.

6/10/04 - fakewww.c  v3.0.12
  Added timestanps to log file.  Format is now date/time [ip addr]
    file requested, action (success/failure).

6/8/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.11
  Changed name to ANL/Intenet2 NDT server.
  Added in code to check for localhost IP address.  If client
    is using 127.0.0.1, the set device to 'lo' so the link detection
    algorithm reports something instead of -1

4/29/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.10
  bug fix.  Incorrect scale factor was being applied to the Sndbuf,
    MaxRwinRcv, and MaxCwnd parameters.  This caused erroneous
    throughput limits when caluclating the BW*Delay product for 
    these buffer sizes.
 
4/22/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.9
  Changed CurMSS to MaxMSS, to report the best we ever got
  slightly different debug message when printing queue details
  removed queue management logic from SIGALRM processing.  This
    processing is now handled properly in the SIGCHLD section
    of the code. (note, that the SIGALRM is handled in the child
    process so the queue pointer is NULL.)

4/22/04 - web100-util.c
  Changed routine to return scaled  Sndbuf value instead of raw
    X_Sndbuf

4/22/04 - web100clt.c
  added command line option processing.  Valid options are
	-d (debug), -b (set send/receive buffer size), and -i
	(increase message level details)
  bug fix, MSS value is reduced by 12 when timestamps are enabled,
    now correctly report this and fix middlebox detection.
  Add debug printing to see what setsockopt() does when changing
    send/receive window size.
  change, scale Sndbuf and MaxRwinRcvd variables by winscale
    factor.
  bug fix, report the client & server views of what IP addresses
    are involved.  Makes NAT detection operate properly
  minor changes to diagnostic messages

4/22/04 - Tcpbw100.java - v5.3.1a
  Added code to retireve and process the RecWinScale KIS variable
  Changed diagnostic messages that reported bw*delay values.  New
    messages clearly state which host is using which buffer

4/13/04 - web100-util.c
  Added RcvWinScale variable to list of KIS variables

4/13/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.8
  bug fix, get current start time, used to report in log file
  bug fix, retrieve and use RcvWinScale value
  changed select() to use variable instead of fixed value for 
    number of file descriptors
  handle case where select() terminated due to Signal instead
    of data input.
  changed MaxRwinRcvd, Sndbuf, and MaxCwnd variables to scale
    by RcvWinscale.

4/13/04 - web100clt.c
  new program.  This web100clt program allows access to the 
    web100srv program via a command line interface.  It is
    a replacement for / supplement to the java based browser
    client.  It allows a user/administrator to run the client
    process on a local/remote computer without the need for a
    web browser.  The dis-advantage is that the source code
    must be downloaded and installed prior to running a test.
    The client has been successfully compiled on Linux and FreeBSD
    hosts.

4/13/04 - web100-admin.c
  Bug fix, write admin_discription.html file into directory
    specified at compile time as BASEDIR.

4/9/04 - web100-admin.c
  changed web100_perror() messages to only print when debug mode
    is enabled.
  Retrieved RcvWinScale KIS variable

4/6/04 - fakewww
  Modified fakewww server to operate in 'Federated' mode.
  In this mode, several servers can act as a single system
  and re-direct clients to a 'better' server.  The default
  mode will be that a client will be directed to the 'closest'
  server (see Readme-fakewww for more details).  This change
  added 2 new modules to the fakewww program
	fakewww.c - contains the main routines needed to 
		send the html and java files back to the
		client.  It also calls several new routines
		to run traceroute and comparison functions
		when operating in federated mode
	tr-tree.c - contains routines needed to compare a
		single traceroute with a map of routes to
		all other servers.
	troute.c - a stripped down version of the standard
		traceroute.c program from the traceroute.org
		web site.

4/6/04 - tr-mkmap.c
  In addition to this new fakewww program, the tr-mkmap program
  is created to build the traceroute map file needed by the 
  fakewww program.  (see Readme-fakewww for more details).

3/22/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.7
  modified server code to send calculation results to the
  client.  The original code required the server and the 
  java applet to independantly run the detection algorithms
  to determine if any problems exist.  This change moves
  the calculation function onto the server.  The results are
  shipped over to the client for printing.  (Hopefully this
  will make it easier to create a command line client as only
  1 program will need to be modified if/when the detection
  algorithms change.

3/22/04 - Tcpbw100.java v5.3.0b
  modified client code to retrieve calculated data from the
  server instead of making its own calculations.  As noted
  above, the server was changed to transmit this data to the
  client.

3/16/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.6
	- web100-util.c
  bug fix.  The web100_get_data() routine was causing the 
  server program to crash when no web100 data was available
  for the requested connnection.  How test to ensure the 
  the connection pointer (cn) is not NULL, return with error
  flag if it is.

3/9/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.3 to 3.0.5
  Moved from single web100srv.c file to multiple source files
  to make code easier to understand and maintain.  There are now
  4 major files.
	web100srv.c - this file contains the main() routine and
		other routines that use common global variables.
		This include the pcap routines that use global
		variables.  The main() loop was also redone to
		make it clearer what happens in the parent and
		child processes.  This made it easier to implement
		the scheduling/queuing functions described below
	web100-util.c - this file contains the routines needed
		to retrieve the web100 data.
	web100-pcap.c - this file contains the routines needed 
		to handle the packet-pair timing functions.  Some
		of these routines are still in the web100srv.c
		file because they used global variables.
	web100-admin.c - this file contains the routines needed
		to handle the generation of the administrator view
		html file.
	web100srv.h - this file contains header information and
		global structures.

  This changes also incorporated 2 new features.
	Config file support - the web100srv program can now process
		run time options from a configuration file in addition
		to the command line options.  It uses routines from
		the libI2util.a file to perform this task.  By default
		the file "/etc/ndt.conf" contains these run time options.
	Scheduling/queuing support - the web100srv program can now
		handle multiple simultaneous client requests in a FIFO
		manner.  Incoming test requests are handled when they
		arrive and if a new request arrives while a test is
		in progress, the new request is queued for service at
		a later time.  The client is informed that its test
		request is pending and an estimated wait time is
		displayed on the client's screen.  This wait time is
		updated everytime a client leaves the system.

  Finally, a support for a HUP signal was added.  When this signal is
  received, the client re-reads the web100_variables file allowing the
  server to learn new variables without requiring a it to be killed/restarted.
  The HUP signal also causes the server to re-read the log file to update
  the administrator view page.  This occurs only if this option is enabled.

3/9/04 - Tcpbw100.java v5.2.2d
  added code to support the server based scheduling/queuing feature.  The
  client now starts out in a wait loop, looking for a 'start' signal to
  arrive.  Once this signal arrives, the program operates as before.

3/2/04 - fakewww.c
  Added in new code to support a basic server discovery function.  This
  function uses routines from 2 additional sources.  The sever can also
  send a basic re-direct message to the client, allowing the server to
  point the client to a 'better' server.  This process opeates as follows
	* a client connects to the fakewww server to run a test.
	* the fakewww server runs a traceroute back to the client's IP addr
	* this resulting route is compared to a map of routes to all other
	  servers.  (built by the tr-tree program).
	* the client is sent a web page that will re-direct it to the new
	  server.

  To accomplish this function 2 new files were created.  They are:
	troute.c - this file is a stripped down version of the basic
		traceroute.c program available from the traceroute.org
		web site's source code section.  The options processing
		has been stripped out, and the run-time options are
		used to suit the fakewww program needs.  Note that root
		access is now needed to retireve the raw ICMP replies.
	tr-tree.c - this file contains a subset of the routines needed
		to compare the retireved route with a map of routes
		from this server to all other possible servers.

1/19/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.2
  bug fix.  Opened pipe() to pass data beteen child & parent
  processes and then used /tmp file as describe in 1/5/04 note.
  Pipe() were never closed, so all file descriptors were used
  up and select() failed causing packet-pair timing data to be
  lost.  Removed reference to pipe() call.

1/19/04 - Tcpbw100.java v 5.2.1d
  changed packet loss equation to use CongestionSignals and
  PktsOut variables.  Matches server equation.

1/5/04 - web100srv.c v3.0.1
  bug fix.  The new (-a) flag failed to continuously update
  the admin page.  Several variables are updated in the child
  process that communicates with the client.  These changes 
  were lost when the child terminated.  These vars are now
  passed between children via the /tmp/view.string file.
  Used fcntl() to lock/unlock /tmp/view.string file to ensure
  only 1 child updates it at a time.

11/30/03 - web100srv.c v3.0.0
  added new (-a) flag to enable the NDT to generate and display
  a set of summary tables and usage statistics.  This flag causes
  the NDT server to automatically generate a new HTML file
  and exports this file to the world via the URL {ndt}/admin.html
  location.  

10/20/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.7
  changed (-b) flag to accept user defined buffer value.  Option
  also defaults to (64000 Bytes) if -b is present, but no value
  is specified.

10/16/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.7
  new flag (-b) installed that controls the TCP send and receive
  buffer size.  This changes the default behavior of the server.
  Old behavior called setsockopt() to lock send/recv buffers to
  60 KB.  New behavior uses system default settings and option
  invokes old behavior.

9/25/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.6
  new flag (-m) installed that allows operators to select operational
  procedure.  Server can run with fixed ports, meaning only 1 test
  can be performed at a time.  Use -m flag to switch to ephermal
  ports, meaning multiple tests can be run simultaneously.  
    Note: multiple tests interfer with each other.

9/22/03 - Makefile
  added support for making Tcpbw100.jar file.  The java archive
  .jar format combines all .class files into a single compressed
  archive file.  This archive file is sent to the browser instead
  of the individual .class files.

9/22/03 - fakewww.c
  added Tcpbw100.jar to the list of files the fakewww server can
  send to the client.  This list prevents arbritray files from being
  returned to a client.

9/16/03 - Tcpbw100.java v5.2.1c
  started adding in code to perform cut&paste operation.  Current
  code fails to access the system clipboard, SecurityException
  occurs instead.  Button on "Statistics" and "More Details"
  windows is left unactive due to this exception.

9/16/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.5
  changed formula to calculate packet loss rate.  (per Matt Mathis)

9/15/03 - Tcpbw100.java v5.2.1c
  added support to close pop-up "Statistics" and "More Details"
  windows.  They now close when you click the window close button
  (X in upper left corner of Win-xx screen).

9/15/03 - fakewww.c
  added 2 new file names to list of downloadable files.  The
  files Tcpbw100$1.class and Tcpbw100$clsFrame.class are sub-
  classes in the Tcpbw100.java file.  They are automactically
  created by javac and implement the window close function.

9/12/03 - Tcpbw100.java v5.2.1b
  Added Panel() frame to main window.  This groups the 3 buttons
  "Statistics, More Details, and Report Problems" into a panel.
  This panel is then placed at the bottom of the frame.  The
  "Start" button now shows up next to the text window.

9/8/03 - Tcpbw100.java v5.2.1a
  added Panel() frame to "Statistics" and "More Details" pop=up
  windows.  This allow the window to resize properly and keeps
  the "Close" button at the bottom of the window.

7/28/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.4
  fixed web100 variable names to use current names, old names 
    were depricated.

7/28/03 - web100_variables
  fixed web100 variable names to use current names, old names
    were depricated.

7/9/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.3
  modified exit code value in init_pkttrace() routine.  If pcap
  errors occur, exit(0) will keep program from failing.  Original
  code used negative code values which caused the child to signal
  the parent making the parent also exit.

6/27/03
  modified INSTALL file to include text stating that the web100srv
  process needs 3 ports to operate (3001-3003).
    reported by "Irene Barg <ibarg@noao.edu>"

6/16/03
  included packet trace and log analysis programs in base package
    - viewtrace.c (viewtrace -f ndttrace.ip.port).  Prints packet
	pair statistics from captured trace file
    - analyze.c (analyze -f log.file).  Run web100srv.log (default)
	file through off-line analysis routines.  Very verbose right
	now.  Use at your own risk.

6/13/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.2
  added -t option to command line, creates packet trace for
	future analysis.  Uses libpcap 'dump' command to 
	write trace file (ndttrace.clientIP.port)

6/12/03 - web100srv.c v2.9.1
  added -v option to command line, prints version number
  modified debug statements, prints messages to stderr with -d option

3/10/03 - web100-spdchk.c  v2.9
  Added getuid() support to check for root user access
  Incremented version number 
  Built in support for packet-pair timings (was speed-chk)
    use pipe() to create communications channel
    use fork() to create pcap based children
    pass clients IP address & port number to pcap child
    use USR1 & USR2 signals to terminate pkt sniffing
    simplified packet collection routines
    wrapped debug messages to suspress unwanted logging
    increased number of link clasification bins
    pass messages between parent and child to synchronize actions
    fixed bug when calling calculate_spd() with port 3003
    added MaxCwnd to list of retrieved variables
  removed code for communicating with stand-alone speed-chk routine
    removed UDP sockets for read/write channels
    removed select() calls
  added code to synchronize communications with applet
    messages sent between tests (middlebox, client throughput,
	server throughput
    messages sent during throughput tests, applet opens connection
	and waits for OK to start data xfer test
  added code to use pkt-pair timing data for link type detection
    new code to determine link type
    new code to send link type to applet


3/10/03 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.2.0e
  new code to synchronize communications with server program
    messages passed to start each test
    messages passed to open socket for throughput test
    applet waits for OK from server program before proceeding
  bug fix to throughput results, using int instead of long
    fix supplied by 
  new messages to report OS and Java info
  new link detection algorithm
    uses pkt-pair data passed over from server program
    new messages to report pkt-pair data
    no-longer assumes 100 Mbps FastEthernet
    new diagnostic messages, identifies bottleneck link type
  new congestion experienced algorithm
  changed Cwnd BW*Delay product to use MaxCwnd instead of CurrentCwnd
  changed email string to use %0a instead of \n for line break

3/10/03 - tcpbw100.html
  redid base web page
    new look with bullet items indicating test being done
    links to other public NDT servers
    
Jan 2003 to Mar 2003 - experimental work on packet-pair timing
  Work began on methods to use packet-pair timings to determine
  bottleneck link speed.  Idea based on TCP dynamics whereby
  back-to-back packets will be injected into the network on numerous
  occations.  These packets will be shaped by intervening queues
  so that they arrive at the rate supported by the slowest link
  in the path.  If enough of these packets arrive, we should be
  able to detect this bottleneck link rate.  This detection should
  be independant of the measured throughput for the test.

  Preliminary data was collected during the SC'02 conference and
  post processed to validate the approach.  The approach taken is
  to 'quantize' the results by placing individual packet-pair measurements
  into unique 'speed bins'.  The LBL Libpcap utility is used to
  place the network interface in promiscous mode and capture packets.
  The throughput achieved between each packet-pair is calculated and
  stored in the proper bin.  Statistical analysis is then used to
  determine what type of link caused these results.
  
  The prototype code was then simplified and rolled into the main
  web100srv.c program.

10/10/02 - web100srv.c
  Changes to support new Web100 a1.2 userland library code
  general code cleanup including:
    new local_find_connection() routine to retrieve connection data
    reworked middelware reporting code to user for loop
    moved web100_agent* code inside main loop instead of in lookup routine
    report unimplemented KIS variables (uses printf's on stdout)

10/4/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.1.1
  Started adding code for middlebox detection (NAT, Firewalls, etc)
  currently server set MAX_SEG value to 1456 and send negotiated value
  back to client.  If they aren't the same, then something changed it
  (Firewalls, or VPN clients are the obvious reasons).
  NAT detection has server send socket data back to client, code also
  catches IE's habit of using localhost instead of FQDN/IP data.

9/12/02 - web100srv.c
  added new command line option to allow the log file name to be
  specified.  Uses -l option.  Defaults to ./web100srv.log

9/11/02 - web100srv.c
  added new command line option to allow web100_variables file
  to be specified.  Uses -f option.  Defaults to ./web100_variables

8/1/02 - web100srv.c
  added setsockopt() function calles to set the SO_REUSEADDR option 
  on the data ports.  This allows the data ports to be re-used
  immediately after they are closed.  This avoids the timeout
  period between tests.

7/15/02 - web100srv.c
  added command line parameter processing to support logging of
  receiver side statistics.  This eliminates the need for the
  web100srv-recv.c code.  The web100srv program now supports 3
  options.  1) -p specify port number (3001 is default). 2) -h
  prints simple usage text. 3) -r record receiver side stats.

6/28/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.0.3
  Changed tests for 10 Mbps link condition.  Test now looks at
  forward and reverse speeds, packet loss, and out-of-order
  packet delivery.  Also added in new test for unknown link
  type.  If throughput > estimate, then link = unknown.

6/28/02 - web100srv-recv.c
  Changed tests for 10 Mbps link condition to match those in
  the Tcpbw100.java file.

6/27/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.0.2
  Changed email diagnostics messages to report conditional test
  statements (link type, duplex setting, duplex-mismatch, ...)

6/26/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.0.1
  Changed email diagnostic messages to report throughput values.
  Added "End of Email Message" text to email diagnostic report.

6/24/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v5.0.0
  Added in new feature and bumped major version number to 5.
  New feature is email button in Java applet.  This button 
  calls the URL mailto: function passing data through the
  browser to the users email client.  The userid, nodename,
  and optional subject line are stored in the base tcpbw100.html
  page as applet PARAM NAME/VALUE pairs.  This allows the local
  admin to configure the email without needing to re-compile the
  applet.  If no subject line is found a default message is
  inserted that included the servers name.

  Open bug - the clients name needs to be automatically inserted
  into the email and more details diagnostic pages.  Currently I
  use the getLocalHost() function to obtain this info.  This works
  with Netscape 4.x browsers with the Sun JVM, however the MS JVM 
  used by IE 5.x browsers returns 'localhost/127.0.0.1' instead.

6/17/02 - web100srv-recv.c
  Modified server process to log web100 values for both throughput
  tests.  When the server is receiving data the values are separated
  by the ';' character.  When the server is transmitting data the
  values are separated by the ',' character.  All variables listed
  in the 'web100_variables' file are recorded in the receive direction,
  while only a subset of these are recorded in the xmit direction.

6/7/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.6.7
  Changed tests for duplex-mismatch condition.  Replaced test
  for (packet loss < 1%) with (estimated throughput > 2 Mbps).
  Remote DSL/Cable modem lines were creating false positives.

6/6/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.6.6
  fixed bug in calculating waitsec.  Should be CurrentRTO/1000

6/4/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.6.6
  Changed tests for congestion condition.  Added test for
  (MaxSsthresh > 0) indicating that the slow start algorithm
  had been invoked.  Previous case lead to false positives.

  Changed "Server busy" messages to tell the user to wait x sec
  before retrying test.  This improves the user interface when
  someone tries to run back-to-back tests.  

  Added new 'waitsec' variable to report percent of time connection
  spends waiting after a timeout.  
	waitsec = (CurrentRTO/100) * Timeouts

6/4/02 - Web100srv.c
  added CurrentRTO variable to list of variables being logged


5/x/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.6.5
  Added tests for Wireless and DSL/Cable modem links

  changed output messages to report unknown link type

  fixed bug in duplex-mismatch direction test (variable spd
    was remaining 0 due to division of integers).

  fixed bug in window scaling report.  Windows 9x boxes set
    value to -1, which code reports as 4294967295.  


4/4/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.5.5
  reworked conditional tests and messages sections to report Link Type,
    duplex-mismatch, Excessive Errors, Duplex (full/half), and congestion


3/6/02 - Web100srv.c
  Changed logging routine to report more variables in comma (,) separated
    line.  Data can be imported into external program for analysis

  
2/21/02 - Tcpbw100.java v4.4.1
  Reworked conditional tests and messages to report link type
    (GigE, FastE, and Enet)


1/10/02 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.3.3
  Added new Statistics button for drill down view

  Redid analysis messages to use 'statistics' and 'more details' 
    buttons


12/4/01 - Tcpbw100.java  v4.2.10
